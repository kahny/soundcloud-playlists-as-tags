#Sounddrop 
Search for songs on soundcloud and create your own playlists using hashtags.

##Overview
Add hashtags to songs you find to create multiple playlists. 

###Motivation
Rather than the typical format of creating individual playlists, I wanted to instead find songs and add hashtags about what the song reminds you of in order to create playlists.
