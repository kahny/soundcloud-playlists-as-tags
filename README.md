#Sounddrop 
Search for songs from Soundcloud and create your own playlists using hashtags. You can add one or many hashtags at once to each song retrieved from your search results. 

##Motivation
Rather than the typical format of creating individual playlists, I wanted to instead find songs and add hashtags about what the song reminds me of in order to create playlists. For instance if a song reminds you of the #beach, #sundays, and #roadtrips, after you add these three hashtags the song will appear in those three playlists.
